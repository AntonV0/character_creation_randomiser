## Project #35 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
The aim of this project is to build a JavaScript message generator program which produces a randomised output each time it runs.

I chose to build a character creation randomiser that gives the user a random character's initials, their age, and their favourite colour.
## What I Learned
  - Creating an array that stores alphabetical letters using UTF-16 code units

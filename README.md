## A Mixed Messages Project From Codecademy
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0), started on the 1st of August 2022

## Project Outline
The **Character Creation Randomiser** is a basic message generator built on JavaScript, designed to be used with command line.  
Every time a user runs this program, they will get a new, randomised output. This output includes the character's *initials*, their *age*, and their *favorite color*.

To run this script, it is recommended to have Node.js set up locally.
